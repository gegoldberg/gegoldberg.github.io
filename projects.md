Below are some of my recent projects as a Computer Science student.

### **Maze Solver**

This project is a maze solver, in which the user can input a file that meets the requirements, and the program
will automatically solve it. The program shows the paths it attempts, as well as the optimal path from start to finish.
This code was created in Java, using Eclipse. One of the most challenging parts was creating the method that solved
the maze, which utilized a "textMaze" interface, which we learned in our CSC111 class. The code had to check all possible routes,
and determine which route allowed it to continue to reach the end goal of the maze file. Once solved, the maze will then save the
maze to a new "solved" file. This project is one of my most difficult assignments so far, and was a lot of fun to create.


### **Interactive Scene**

This project was an interactive scene, in which we took an art creation and allowed for the user to interact with it.
The code utilized Wheels, a Java GUI that allowed the user to create shapes and interactions in the program. In this case,
I created a simple neighborhood design that allowed the user to interact with objects such as the clouds, trees, and more.
The most challenging part was utilizing associations, a concept we learned in our SER120 class. This involved one object's
interactions affecting the functions of another. In this case, when the sun is dragged, the sky changes color.
This was a lot of fun, and allowed me to be creative and learn the depths of object oriented design.


### **SER225 Game Project**

#### [GitHub Page for Game Project](https://github.com/AndrewLabbe/Squirrel_RPG)

This is a game created for Quinnipiac's SER225 Agile Development Class. We were put into teams for the entire semester, a we utilized agile development to work further on a game. Named, "Squirrel RPG", we created a RPG-Style game created entirely in Java. We utilized a java engine to create and develop this game, including unique movement features, mechanics, and more. This project and course spanned the whoel semester, and was one of the most unique and in-depth projects I had completed so far. This project allowed for creative freedom, where you could implement and create any game mechanics you could imagine.

<!-- The projects page is where you are going to link to some of your GitHub projects and write a description
of them (what did you make, what language did you use, anything interesting/challenging about it, etc.).
I would assume most of you wonâ€™t have many projects on GitHub since you are in a Git class currently,
so go ahead and create repos and push code up for the projects you are proudest of. Please include at
least two projects -->
