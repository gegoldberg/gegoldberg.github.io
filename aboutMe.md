### My Name is Garrett Goldberg.

I'm a resident in Cheshire, CT, and am currently enrolled at Quinnipiac University
as a Computer Science Major. I previously attended Cheshire High School, where I found my passion for technology.
I've always been surrounded by computers, and now I've finally gotten a chance to put that experience
to good use.

### Experience

I currently have experience with Java, Scala, and Git. I plan on deepening my understanding of these languages, as well
as expand my knowledge of others in the future. I want to be able to maintain a skillset that is vital in the success
of my career, and can contribute as much as possible to the company.

### Hobbies

My hobbies consist of going to the gym, soccer, and video games. I've always been an athlete, yet technology
always held a certain importance in my lifestyle. I'm currently part of the esports team at Quinnipiac as well.
